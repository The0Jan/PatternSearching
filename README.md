# PatternSearching


Implementation of pattern searching algorithms done for course 'Algorithms and Data Structures'.


## 1.Implementations performed:
*Naive algorithm \
*Boyer-Moore algorithm 

## 2.Tests.
In order to validate the implemented functions, both algorithms were subjected to a series of tests for the following edge cases: \
*empty one or both input strings \
*input 'string' equal to 'text' \
*input 'string' longer than 'text' \
*input 'string' not present in 'text' \
And a series of tests to see if they both give the same answers for the pseudo-random input.

Both algorithms were also subjected to some preformance tests to see how they perform.

For testing purposes the example file 'pan_tadeusz.txt' was used.
